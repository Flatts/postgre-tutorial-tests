--Fetch clause is similar to limit BUT is the standard across all SQL 
--Always used with Order By to get proper results
--Syntax:

OFFSET start { ROW | ROWS }				Start is an INT 0 or positive		ROW and Rows are synonyms 	
FETCH { FIRST | NEXT } [ row_count ] { ROW | ROWS } ONLY				Row count is 1 or greater		First and next are synonyms
